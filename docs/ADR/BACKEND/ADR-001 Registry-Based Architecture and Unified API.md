# ADR-001: Registry-Based Architecture & Unified API

**Date:** 2025-12-14
**Status:** Accepted
**Context:** Backend Scalability & Maintenance
**Authors:** ActionPlan PM, Backend Team

## Context

In the initial Proof of Concept (PoC), the platform supported two algorithms: Interval Coverage and Binary Search. Each algorithm had:

1. A dedicated API endpoint (e.g., `/api/trace/binary-search`).
2. Dedicated Pydantic models in `app.py` for input validation.
3. Hardcoded routing logic in `app.py`.

**The Problem:**
To add a 3rd, 4th, or Nth algorithm, a developer would need to:

- Modify `app.py` (violating the Open/Closed Principle).
- Add new route handlers.
- Define new Pydantic models in the global scope.
- Update the Frontend to point to a new URL.

This approach creates high coupling between the core application server and specific algorithm implementations, making the platform brittle and hard to scale.

## Decision

We will adopt a **Registry-Based Architecture** with a **Unified API Endpoint**.

### 1. The Registry Pattern

We will implement a central `AlgorithmRegistry` singleton that manages available algorithms.

- **Mechanism:** Algorithms "self-register" or are registered at startup.
- **Lookup:** The registry maps string keys (e.g., `"binary-search"`) to `AlgorithmTracer` classes.
- **Discovery:** The registry provides metadata (display name, description, examples) for UI population.

### 2. The Unified API Endpoint

We will replace all algorithm-specific endpoints with a single entry point:

- **Route:** `POST /api/trace/unified`
- **Payload Contract:**
  ```json
  {
    "algorithm": "string (key)",
    "input": { ...algorithm_specific_data... }
  }
  ```

### 3. Abstract Base Class (`AlgorithmTracer`)

All algorithms must inherit from a base class that enforces a standard interface:

- `execute(input_data)`: Returns the standard trace format.
- `get_prediction_points()`: Returns active learning moments.
- `generate_narrative()`: Returns the human-readable explanation.

### 4. Input Validation Delegation

Input validation responsibility moves from `app.py` (global Pydantic models) to the specific `Tracer` classes. `app.py` only validates the envelope (`algorithm` and `input` fields exist).

## Consequences

### Positive

- **Scalability:** Adding a new algorithm requires **zero changes** to `app.py` or frontend routing logic.
- **Decoupling:** `app.py` acts purely as a dispatcher. Algorithm logic is isolated in `backend/algorithms/`.
- **Frontend Simplicity:** The frontend uses a single `useTraceLoader` hook that hits one endpoint, changing only the payload.
- **Dynamic UI:** The "Algorithm Switcher" dropdown is populated dynamically via `GET /api/algorithms`, meaning new algorithms appear automatically.

### Negative

- **Runtime Discovery:** If an algorithm fails to register (e.g., import error), it simply won't appear, which can be harder to debug than a hard crash.
- **Loose Typing:** The `input` field in the API is generic JSON (`dict`). We lose the strict compile-time/startup-time validation of global Pydantic models in favor of runtime validation inside the Tracer.

## Compliance

This architecture is **LOCKED**.

- **Do not** add new routes to `app.py` for specific algorithms.
- **Do not** hardcode algorithm names in the frontend API calls.
- **Must** inherit from `AlgorithmTracer`.
