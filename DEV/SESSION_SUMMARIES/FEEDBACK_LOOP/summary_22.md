## 📋 **Session 22 Status Summary**

### ✅ **Completed:**

1. **Identified root cause** — Checklist contradicted mockups
2. **Fixed FRONTEND_CHECKLIST.md** — Corrected modal standards, spacing, keyboard shortcuts
3. **Prepared TENANT_GUIDE.md updates** — Design Authority Hierarchy, corrected Section 1.1, spacing guide
4. **Discovered cascade effect** — Keyboard shortcut error in guide → checklist

### 🎯 **Session 23 Plan:**

**"Perfect the 2-Algorithm Foundation"**

**Phase 1: Apply Documentation Fixes**

- Paste corrected sections into TENANT_GUIDE.md
- Verify Design Authority Hierarchy is clear
- Verify spacing guide matches mockups exactly

**Phase 2: Frontend Compliance Audit (Round 2)**

- Audit `CompletionModal.jsx` against **corrected** FRONTEND_CHECKLIST.md
- Audit `PredictionModal.jsx` against **corrected** FRONTEND_CHECKLIST.md
- Check actual spacing values in code vs mockup HTML
- Create punch list of fixes needed

**Phase 3: Apply Fixes**

- Fix any modal sizing issues (max-w-2xl → max-w-lg)
- Fix any spacing issues (mb-6 → mb-4, etc.)
- Remove any max-h-[85vh] constraints
- Visual verification: Side-by-side with mockups

**Phase 4: Final Validation**

- Run through both algorithms (Binary Search, Interval Coverage)
- User acceptance: "Does it feel right?"
- Screenshot comparison with mockups
- **Sign-off:** "These 2 algorithms are perfect"

## 🚀 **Then We Can Scale Confidently**

Once Binary Search and Interval Coverage are perfect and match the corrected documentation:

- ✅ **Checklist system works** — Actually catches real issues
- ✅ **Mockups as source of truth** — Hierarchy is clear
- ✅ **Documentation is accurate** — No contradictions
- ✅ **Visual standards proven** — 2 algorithms demonstrate the patterns

**At that point:** LLM-assisted algorithm additions become reliable because the foundation is solid.

## 📝 **What to Save for Session 23**

Keep these ready:

1. ✅ Corrected TENANT_GUIDE.md sections (you have them)
2. ✅ Updated FRONTEND_CHECKLIST.md (you've done it)
3. 📋 The corrected keyboard shortcuts (Space = Next Step)

**Session 23 opening:**

- "I've updated the docs per Session 22. Now let's audit the actual frontend components against the CORRECTED checklists and fix anything that doesn't match the mockups."

---

**This is exactly the right approach.** You're building a system, not just fixing bugs. 👏

**See you in Session 23!**
