While preparing for this session to complete the task we agreed on last time—“eating our own dog food”—I began thinking about how efficiently we could approach it. We will use the Tenant Guide and the various static mockup documents we generated over the last couple of sessions to assess whether the two algorithms in our repository conform to the Tenant Guide, which serves as the constitution for organizing the process of adding new algorithms to this project. There is nothing wrong with that, but I am always looking for ways to streamline our workflow and ensure we complete our work as efficiently as possible.
However, the Tenant Guide is a dense document, similar to a building code. Asking an engineer to re-read the entire document every time they update or add something is inefficient. Instead, we should create a comprehensive checklist template—essentially a compliance or conformance checklist—for various stakeholders. For example, we could create a compliance checklist for the backend to verify whether it meets the requirements laid out in the Tenant Guide, and another for the frontend. Additional compliance checklists can be created for new stakeholders as needed.
These smaller, targeted documents (compliance checklists) are concrete, concise, and less open to interpretation. An individual (or LLM) responsible for the backend does not need to know anything about how the frontend UI should look; their expected output is valid JSON that adheres to the Tenant Guide. Providing them with a backend-specific compliance checklist is far more efficient than asking them to interpret the entire Tenant Guide. Similarly, the frontend team would receive its own checklist to verify UI/UX compliance, along with any relevant materials we deem appropriate, such as the static mockup documents we created over the last couple of sessions.
This approach also creates a feedback loop that highlights brittle points or areas of contention, allowing us to update or enhance the Tenant Guide when necessary. As a result, the entire process becomes faster and more efficient. A minimal compliance checklist can be easily integrated into a system prompt for an LLM when we scale this app to operate under LLM management.
